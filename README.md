# Smart-Door-Security-System
This project is a smart door security system that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect visitors, a Python script for face recognition, and a Telegram bot for remote access control. It also uses MQTT for communication and provides physical button access and visual/audio feedback with LEDs and a buzzer.
